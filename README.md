# Crypto Sheets

This is a (javascript-based) tool to aid in creating your own crypto tracking spreadsheet.  It can automagically pull in current cryptocurrency rates, as well as your wallet balances.  It requires the use of Google Sheets and its built-in script editor.

If you want a better understanding of how it works and have no programming experience, it's never too late to learn.  Take a free course at **Codecademy** and flex your brain :muscle::fireworks:.

1. Add triggers to your project ("Edit > Current project's triggers...").  This is how your spreadsheet will update automatically.

   1. In the "Run" dropdown, choose "onOpen" and choose which triggers will refresh the data.  We recommend using "Time-driven/Minutes/Every 30", and "From spreadsheet/On open."

1. You can manually execute the script to test it by clicking the `Select function`, selecting `onOpen`, and clicking the run button (looks like the play symbol)

## Populating `Wallets` Sheet with Account Balances
*Note: Currently supports NANO, ETH, BCH, BTC, DGB, LTC, and VTC.  Update other wallet balances manually in your spreadsheet for the time being.  Feel free to [submit an issue](https://github.com/saitei/crypto-sheets/issues) for other currencies.*

1. If you don't have a `Wallets` sheet, one will automatically be created for you

1. Scroll down to the `WALLET BALANCE CONFIGURATION` section (around line 130)

1. Follow the instructions for each currency to add your address.  You can change the value in `getRange` to output the balance to a different cell in the `Wallets` sheet.

## Market Cap Data

1. A sheet called `Global` will be automatically created for you, and populated with overall Market Cap Data.

## Advanced

There are comments in the code for anything that's not covered here.  If you had to use these instructions, the safe bet is to not modify anything else.

## Using the Data

solifugo has [put together a guide](https://github.com/saitei/crypto-sheets/wiki/Easy-guide-(I-hope)-to-create-a-Portfolio-Tracker) on how to organize data from the Rates sheet.
